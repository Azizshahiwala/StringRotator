🎯 Project: StringRotator – 3D ASCII Renderer
🌀 A creative tool that transforms text or images into animated 3D ASCII in the terminal, built with a Java GUI and Python backend.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Java (Swing) – For the user-friendly GUI
Python – For backend ASCII rendering and image processing
Apache NetBeans – For building and managing the Java project
ProcessBuilder – To launch and control Python scripts from Java
Prompt Engineering – Used AI to debug, optimize logic, and brainstorm design ideas, write logic for perspective and depth.

✨ Features:
Upload text or PNG and convert to 3D ASCII animation
Rotating 3D illusion with lighting and depth effects
Terminal-based animation that resizes with screen
Modular communication via config files (Java ↔ Python)

📚 What I Learned:
✅ How to use AI effectively (prompt engineering, debugging, logic assistance)
✅ How Java interacts with Python using ProcessBuilder
✅ Handling Python output flush and subprocess behavior
✅ Gained understanding of 3D projection logic and Z-buffering
✅ Using Apache NetBeans to manage real-world Java projects
✅ Clean structuring of UI-Backend flow using threads and configuration files
